## Overview 
This project consisted of me writing a program that would print the lyrics to "99 Bottls of Beer on the Wall" to the console. I wrote my code in an IDE on my Macbook Pro. After finishing the code, I used my mac terminal (ssh client) to create a local GitHub repository on the command line. 
In order to create this repository, I utilized *git init* to initialize the repository, *git add* to add my files to the local repository, *git commit* to commit my files to my repository, and *git push* to push my files to the remote repository. 
A remote repository is created using *git remote add origin <repository url>* after creating matching reposiroty on GitHub's website.
